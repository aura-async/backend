# Body Shape Model

This directory is a placeholder for the body shape ML model file.

The API will work without this file, using fallback mode. For enhanced accuracy, you can add:

- `body_shape_model.pkl` (size: ~1.6 MB)

When this file is present, the API will automatically use it instead of fallbacks.
